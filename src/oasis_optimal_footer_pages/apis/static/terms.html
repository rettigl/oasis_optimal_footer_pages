            <p class="heading">1. Background</p>
            <p>NOMAD (= NOMAD Services, Services) are managed by [MPCDF and FHI on behalf of Max-Planck-Society] for hosting, organizing, sharing, visualizing and analyzing materials data. Also other sites can provide the Services. Their aim is to provide a platform for granting access to materials data (= Content) for discovering, viewing and analyzing it. NOMAD may be used by uploading Content to NOMAD (as Submitter), by downloading (and using) Content from NOMAD or via the Artificial Intelligence Toolkit, or Encyclopedia (= Tools, as User). Content uploaded to NOMAD is made available subject to the rules of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License</a>.</p>
            <p class="heading">2. Agreement</p>
            <p>By using any of the services available at this website (= Services) through either registering, uploading, downloading or using Content you represent that you have the legal authority to accept these Terms and that you agree to be bound by them.</p>
            <p class="heading">3. Changes</p>
            <p>Provider reserves the right to modify or add to these Terms without giving specific notice. All revised Terms apply to the use of the Services from the date of their publication on this website.</p>
            <p class="heading">4. Registration</p>
            <p>Uploading Content to NOMAD requires Submitter’s registration. By registering, Submitter represents of being of legal age to form a binding contract and agrees to only provide true and accurate information about herself/himself. Registration is also needed to use significant resources with the NOMAD Tools and to save and access the data later. However, NOMAD tools can also be accessed without registration as a guest user. NOMAD maintains a customer register and a customer register information sheet in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and national data protection regulation. The <a href="./privacy.html">NOMAD Privacy Policy</a> contains a detailed description.</p>
            <p>Personal data that is entered in the registration process is used mainly for authorization purposes, except for uploaded content, see 5.4., and will not be given to third parties unless required by law. See Privacy Policy for more detailed description (Coming soon).</p>
            <p>Provider reserves the right to refuse or cancel a registration at any time for any reason or no reason at all.</p>
            <p class="heading">5. Submitter’s obligations</p>
            <p class="sub-heading">5.1 Form</p>
            <p>Users may submit input and output files in their raw format as produced by the utilized code. Code and code version must be retrievable from the uploaded files.</p>
            <p>Together with each uploaded Content Submitter has to provide the names of all right-holders, i.e. co-authors of the Content.</p>
            <p class="sub-heading">5.2 Warranty</p>
            <p>By uploading Content to NOMAD Submitter warrants that</p>
            <ul>
            <li>content submitted by her/his and made available through the Service does not infringe the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary rights</li>
            <li>she/he owns or otherwise controls all rights in the Content being required for&nbsp
                <p>(a) submitting the Content to NOMAD and</p>
                <p>(b) granting third parties access to the open access Content on the basis of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License implying that Submitter retains any copyright that he/she may have in the Content while permission is granted to anyone to copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt the Content, without obtaining specific permission from the Submitter(s) or NOMAD, provided proper attribution is given to the Submitter(s) and to the source of the Content. See also 5.4.</p>
                <p>(c) It is the Submitter's responsibility to make sure that the Content does not contain personal information that is not intended to be open access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>all Content submitted relates to the computational materials science calculations having been obtained by the specified computer code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="sub-heading">5.3 License</p>
            <p>By uploading Content to NOMAD Submitter agrees to and grants third parties the right to use the open access Content on the basis of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.</a></p>
            <p class="sub-heading">5.4 Scope of access</p>
            <p>At Submitter’s choice, Content may either be made available to all users (open access data) or be made available only to specific users (restricted data) including Submitters/right-holders and explicitly named users.</p>
            <p>Restricted data will automatically become open access data three years after their upload. In this case, only those files will be scanned that are required to retrieve the metadata and the unique identifier. Submitter can make the Content open access also earlier.</p>
            <p>Metadata (=general information on the Content, such as material, used code and code version, method, upload date, Submitter, and co-authors, provided references) will always be visible to all users, whether the data is made available as open access data or restricted data.</p>
            <p>Content, once uploaded, will be kept and made available for at least 10 years. Once uploaded, Submitter has no possibility to erase the Content but may only correct it by uploading a newer version that will be linked to the old one.</p>
            <p>It is possible that the Content will be mirrored to multiple sites providing access to researchers as Service. A mirror site may also be outside EU/EEA. In this case the mirror site will be required to sign the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&amp;from=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal data transfer standard EU contractual clauses</a> to guarantee the safety of the personal data.</p>
